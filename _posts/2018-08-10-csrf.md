## Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) Attack  

Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end-user to execute unwanted actions on the web application on a currently logged in session. This attack leverages the lack of security on the transmission of POST requests data. An attacker craft and host a pre-defined request which contains a html form data. This link will be sent to a user. When the user clicks on the link, it performs the actions defined in the request without the user's awareness using the currently authenticated session. The reason for this action, the browser's default behaviour is to share the session cookies with the request for the authenticated application. 
**Example Scenario**

User A is logged in to netbanking and performing transactions on the application. Malicious user B sent a link to the user A. User B craft the html request with all the details filled in like amount to transfer, account no etcc. When the user A clicks and executes the request, the application blindly performs the actions defined in the request and user A lost the money. All the actions performed without the User A awareness. 

#### Prone Vectors

All the forms with POST Data sent to the server can be attacked

#### How to Detect CSRF

  - Intercept all the POST requests with Burp and check is there any "CSRF Token" or any request tokens present in the post data.
  - IF they don't have any tokens, then they are vulnerable.
  - Ff the token is static, then the site is still vulnerable

#### Steps to identify and exploit
  Step 1: Let's browse a application to transfer some money  
  Step 2: Enter the account no and amount to transfer

  Step 3: Capture the request to check is there any CSRF Token or request token in the body of the request. Since there is no tokens, it may be vulnerable

  Step 4:Note the money has transferred as shown

  Step 5: To exploit, view the page source and copy the data within the form tags. Form tags are basically used to send the user input to the server via the post method

  Step 5: Now create a new html request with the entire form data and append the "action" field with the hostname. Now Save the request as an html page as shown

  Step 6: Open the created malicious request in the browser and click the "View" button as shown

  Step 7: We have successfully parsed the request as in the step3 as shown

  Step 8: Finally!!! we completed the transaction and exploited CSRF attack
